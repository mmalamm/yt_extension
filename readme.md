# yt_extension

a useful chrome extension that lets you backup/skip 5 seconds using the ⏪/⏩ buttons, even with the youtube video out of focus.

useful for code-alongs and transcriptions when you have the editor focused and the video on another window. Also handy that you dont have to switch tabs or move hands from keyboard.
