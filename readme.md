# yt_extension

a useful chrome extension that lets you backup/skip 5 seconds using the ⏪/⏩ buttons, even with the youtube video out of focus.

useful for code-alongs and transcriptions when you have the editor focused and the video on another window. Also handy that you dont have to switch tabs or move hands from keyboard.

to enable skip/backup with ⏪/⏩ buttons, navigate to desired video and then press `cmd+e`
